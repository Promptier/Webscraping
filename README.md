# Webscraping
Python webscraper for finding stars on Github repo.

See [tutorial](https://promptier.io/Python/Webscraping) and [video]() for more info.

You can schedule scripts like this to run everyday using [windows scheduler](https://datatofish.com/python-script-windows-scheduler/) or [cron](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-schedule-python-scripts-with-cron-the-only-guide-youll-ever-need-deea2df63b4e) if you're on Linux or Mac.

Alternatively, you can use [Star History](https://github.com/star-history/star-history )
as a more reliable method of tracking a repository as it uses Github's official API for repository metadata.
